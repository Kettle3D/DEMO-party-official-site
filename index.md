-------------------------

Our Main Values
===============

Democracy
---------

Being kind to others (as everyday behavior) and respecting people's thoughts and views on specific subjects and political views

Demonstration
-------------

Showing people how to treat the world like we are living in it! Also, as mention above being kind to people as a part of the communities everyday life.

Our goals
---------

1. To make the world a better place. New problem are arising and we will have to conquer them but sometimes, we cannot fight fire with fire, and eventually the world will go up in flames. (we don't want that to happen)
2. We need to care for plants, ourselves each other and our environment that's why we need to help people as a community if we are doing this well we are: doing  what is best for everyone individually ( as best we can ) and not what is best for everyone non-individually.
